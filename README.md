Python Data Structure - Singly Linked List

Basic structure of a singly linked list
A one-way linked list, also known as a singly linked list, is the simplest form of a linked list. It contains two domains, one is the information domain and the other is the link domain. The link domain is used to point to the next node, and the link domain of the last node points to a null value.

The table element field elem is used to store specific data
The link field next is used to store the location of the next node
The variable p points to the position of the head node of the linked list. Starting from p, any node in the list can be found.

Singly Linked List Operations
is_empty() Is the list empty?
length()List length
travel() traverses the entire linked list
add()Add an element to the head of the linked list
append() adds an element to the end of the linked list
insert() adds an element to any position in the linked list
remove() deletes a node
search() to find out if any node exists
